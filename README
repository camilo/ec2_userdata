Easily reads from EC2 user data and falls back to a local config file if the code is not running on the EC2 cloud.

This library expects your EC2 user data to be in JSON format. From an EC2 machine, you can then do in Ruby:

EC2::UserData["my-key"]

If your code is not running on EC2, for example, during testing/development, ec2_userdata will try to read ./config/ec2_userdata.yml and return values found in that file instead.
